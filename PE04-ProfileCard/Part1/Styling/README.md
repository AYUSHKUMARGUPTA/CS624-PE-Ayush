# Input
The program begins by copying an existing React Native project from previous exercises (HOS05 and HOS06) into separate folders for Part 1 and Part 2. The input includes user profile details such as name, occupation, and a brief description for each profile card. Additionally, layout configurations and styling properties from the textbook (Dabit, 2019) are used as inputs for building and styling components.

# Process
In Part 1, the Profile Card component is enhanced using text styling techniques learned from Chapter 4 of the textbook. The user interface is customized to display a single card with styled text components.

# Output
The final output is a mobile application with an improved and styled Profile Card in Part 1.
