# Hello World

# Input  
The application collects input in two forms. First, it uses hardcoded course names for the 8 core courses, 2 depth of study courses, and 1 capstone course. Second, it accepts user input through a `TextInput` field that lets users enter their favorite course.

# Process  
The app is built using an arrow function component with core React Native components: `View`, `Text`, `ScrollView`, `Image`, `TextInput`, and `StyleSheet`. All courses are displayed using a scrollable layout. The favorite course input is tracked using React's `useState` hook. Styling is handled internally using a single `StyleSheet` object to control layout, spacing, fonts, and image display.

# Output  
The output is a scrollable screen showing an image (icon.png), a categorized list of MSCS courses, and the userâ€™s inputted favorite course, which is displayed after entry. The screen is clean, structured, and mobile-friendly, demonstrating the use of React Native core components effectively.
